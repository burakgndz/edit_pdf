Getting necessary information by reading order_list.csv file and editting technical drawings (pdf files) according to the information. Then, printing all drawings listed in the order_list automatically.
These document are used to categorize product by workers, which helps keeping track of the products.
</li>
<li>
Name of the AutoCAD file is modified according to order_list, and it is saved in a different directory. <br>
<b>Example:</b> product1.dxf will be product1_5MM_S235JR_10pcs.dxf and its directoy will be "../5mm/product1_5MM_S235JR_10pcs.dxf". This will help the one who is preparing the cutting plan of the order while using <a href="https://www.bystronic.com/gbr/en/sw/bysoft-suite">BySoft</a>
